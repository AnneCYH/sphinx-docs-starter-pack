==========================
Documentation starter pack
==========================

The Documentation starter pack contains tools and configuration options for
building a documentation site with Sphinx. It can be used to ensure consistency
across multiple documentation sites.

Its main features include:

* bundled Sphinx theme, configuration, and extensions
* build checks: links, spelling, inclusive language

One strong point of the starter pack is its support for customisation that is
layered on top of a core configuration - this applies to all the above
features. There are also many other goodies included to enrich your doc set.

Enable your repository or work with documentation in an already enabled
repository:

* :doc:`help-enable`
* :doc:`help-usage`
